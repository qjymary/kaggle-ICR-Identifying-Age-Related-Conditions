**Prediction of Elderly Health Status Using Stacking (Kaggle Top 15%)**

Health issues among the elderly have long been a focus of societal concern. With the acceleration of population aging, the health conditions of a large number of elderly individuals are receiving increasing attention from various sectors of society. To address the issue raised by ICR company regarding the difficulty of accurately predicting the health status of the elderly using simple machine learning models, our team developed a solution using a Stacking ensemble model. First, after conducting a visual analysis and exploration of the dataset provided for the competition, we performed preprocessing on the raw data, including imputation and dimensionality reduction. We selected balanced log loss as the classification performance metric based on the prediction target. Next, considering the characteristics of the data, we chose five base models: CatBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and XGBoost. After optimizing the hyperparameters of these models using Optuna, and considering both training time and balanced log loss, we selected LightGBM as the best-performing single model. We then explained the model and analyzed the variables influencing the probability of disease prediction. Subsequently, by comparing various model combinations, we selected CatBoost and XGBoost as the base learners for the Stacking method, with Random Forest as the meta-learner due to its strong generalization ability. This led to the successful development of the final Stacking ensemble model, which achieved a balanced log loss of 0.405.
